2048 is a simple tile game that took the world by storm a few years ago due to it's simplistic and casual nature. The game consists of a 4x4 board that is randomly filled with tiles each time you move, and the player must combine tiles of the same type to keep the board from filling and ending the game. You do this by choosing a direction, and all of the tiles on the board move as far as possible in the direction you chose. Tiles with the same number will combine into larger tiles, and the ultimate goal is to build a 2048 tile.
